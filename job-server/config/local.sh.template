# Environment and deploy file
# For use with bin/server_deploy, bin/server_package etc.
# Note: This file is sourced 2 times
# - ./bin/server_deploy sources this file to load environment variables. It only needs a few e.g. INSTALL_DIR.
#    Variables like $appdir don't have value at this time. It is alright since, nobody is using it.
# - ./bin/server_start sources this file after exporting conffile and appdir. So, these variables become available
#    and correct MANAGER_* variables are placed in the env of jobserver master process. These same variables are
#    also passed as env of driver processes launched through SparkLauncher (since driver processes are a fork of
#    master process)
