# Web API documentation

This folder contains a manually created swagger (and OpenAPI-conform) specification to document the WebAPI thoroughly.
The `swagger.yaml` file can be used as a foundation to generate human-readable documentation (e.g. .html or .md) if needed.

## View documentation

The easiest way to view the documentation is to visit [editor.swagger.io](http://editor.swagger.io/) and upload/paste the specification there.
