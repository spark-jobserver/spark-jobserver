/**
 * NamedRdds - a trait that gives you safe, concurrent creation and access to named RDDs
 * (the native SparkContext interface only has access to RDDs by numbers).
 * It facilitates easy sharing of RDDs amongst jobs sharing the same SparkContext.
 * If two jobs simultaneously tries to create an RDD with the same name,
 * only one will win and the other will retrieve the same one.
 *
 * Note that to take advantage of NamedRddSupport, a job must mix this in and use the APIs here instead of
 * the native RDD `cache()`, otherwise we will not know about the names.
