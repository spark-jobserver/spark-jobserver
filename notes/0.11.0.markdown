## Breaking Changes:
The authentication management has been refactored. As a consequence, existing `shiro` configuration sections have to be
adapted. Previously, `shiro` configuration had to be provided at root level without a prefix. Now, `shiro` configuration
has to be embedded in an additional `access-control` block. An example configuration is available in the
[sources](../job-server/src/main/resources/application.conf#L322).
