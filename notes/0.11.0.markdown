# Scala #akka @ApacheSpark

## Breaking Changes:

- The authentication management has been refactored. As a consequence, existing `shiro` configuration sections have to
  be adapted. Previously, `shiro` configuration had to be provided at root level without a prefix. Now, `shiro`
  configuration has to be embedded in an additional `access-control` block. An example configuration is available in the
  [sources](../job-server/src/main/resources/application.conf#L322).
- The default Python version is switched from Python 2 to Python 3 (namely, from `python` to `python3`). If you would
  still like to use Python 2, adapt the Python executable in
  the [application.conf](../job-server/src/main/resources/application.conf#L210).
